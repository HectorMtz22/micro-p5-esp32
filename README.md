# Counter with Buttons (Debounce and Delay)

This project consists in a counter that increment or decrement by one and shows the output in a 7-Segment Display.

In this project I'm working with the difference between using a Debounce with software or a typical delay for the buttons.

## Folder contents

The project **button_debounce** contains one source file in C language [main.c](main/main.c). The file is located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt` files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets (executable, library, or both).

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── pytest_hello_world.py      Python script used for automated testing
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main.c
└── README.md                  This is the file you are currently reading
```

For more information on structure and contents of ESP-IDF projects, please refer to Section [Build System](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html) of the ESP-IDF Programming Guide.

## Troubleshooting

* Program upload failure

    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.
